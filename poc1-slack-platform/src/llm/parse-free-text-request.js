Reply with one JSON object and nothing else, using exactly these keys:
- visitorType: one of ${choices(VISITOR_TYPES)}
- visitorName: the main visitor, without titles such as Mr. or Ms.
- visitorCompany
- visitorPhone
- companions: array of names of other people coming with the main visitor
- visitDate: YYYY-MM-DD
- startTime, endTime: HH:MM, 24-hour. If only a duration is given, compute endTime from startTime.
- building: one of ${choices(BUILDINGS)}
- floor: floor number as a string
- hostName: the person being visited, without titles
- purpose: short, in the language of the request
- equipment: array, any of ${choices(EQUIPMENT)}
- parking: "yes" only if the request asks for a parking space or says the visitor comes by car or motorbike, else ""
- vehiclePlate
Use an empty string (or an empty array) for anything the request does not state. Do not guess, and do not correct values that look wrong.`;
